Mirage
======
Mirage aids testing of your applications by hosting mock responses so that your applications do not have to talk to real endpoints. It's accessible via HTTP and has a RESTful interface.    

Any ideas/improvements or feedback you have are greatly appreciated.  
  
Information on how to use Mirage can be found [here](https://github.com/lashd/mirage/wiki).  
  
I hope you find it useful,  

Leon

P.s. Currently Mirage runs on Linux and MacOSX; Rubies 1.8, 1.9 and JRuby. Don't worry Windows fans, it's on its way :)

Installation
------------
    gem install mirage
