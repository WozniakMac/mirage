Mirage
======
Mirage aids testing of your applications by hosting mock responses so that your applications do not have to talk to real endpoints. Its accessible via HTTP and has a RESTful interface.  

Any ideas/improvements or feedback you have are greatly appreciated.

I hope you find it useful,  

Leon

P.s. Currently Mirage only runs on Linux; Rubies 1.8, 1.9 and JRuby. I plan to add support for Windows and MacOsX very soon.

Installation
------------
    gem install mirage
