Mirage
======
Mirage aids testing of your applications by hosting mock responses so that your applications do not have to talk to real endpoints. It's accessible via HTTP and has a RESTful interface.    

Any ideas/improvements or feedback you have are greatly appreciated.  
  
Information on how to use Mirage can be found [here](https://github.com/lashd/mirage/wiki).  
  
I hope you find it useful,  

Leon

P.s. Mirage runs on Linux,MacOSX and Windows; Rubies 1.8.7, 1.9 and JRuby.

Installation
